# Portfolio

This repository is to showcase my talent in using various datasets and generating the regression, classification and the time series forecasting models.
 
This repository contains the scaled down versions of the following projects: 
1. Churn prediction which uses:
   1.1 K Means Clustering
   1.2 XGBoost Classification
2. End to End customer Segementation which performs:
   1.1 RFM Clustering
   1.2 LTV Prediction
   1.3 Next Purchase Day Prediction
   1.4 Sales Forecasting using LSTM
3. Iphone purchase SVM
4. Viral Tweet Classification which compares all the classification models and performs hyperparameter tuning for the best accuracy.
5. Interactive chart for data visualisation
